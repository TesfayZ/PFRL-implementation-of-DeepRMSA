# PFRL-implementation-of-DeepRMSA
This is a PFRL (Pytorch version of ChainerRL) implementation of [DeepPRMSA] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8738827)

The stable baseline implementation by Carlos Natalino is here: https://github.com/carlosnatalino/optical-rl-gym/blob/main/examples/stable_baselines3/DeepRMSA.ipynb

To run the PFRL implementation, first install the optical-rl-gym package.
Then move the files in PFRL (not SB3) to the directory of the optical-rl-gym package.
create tmp/deeprmsa-ppo to save results and checkpoints

Othe dependencies include the packages of the stable baseline implementation and installation of the pfrl.
